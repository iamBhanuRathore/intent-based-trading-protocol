🧠 Core Idea
Users express intents (high-level trading goals), like:

"Swap 100 SOL to stSOL with best APY"

"Move idle USDC to the highest-yielding farm"

"Sell 50% of my NFTs and stake the rest"

Instead of manually executing each step, users submit an intent, and solvers (bots) compete to fulfill it optimally. Think of it as request-for-quote (RFQ) meets automation.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
1. User submits an intent
Via UI or CLI

Signed and posted on-chain or off-chain (depending on architecture)

Intent schema: input token(s), amount, goal (e.g. “maximize APY”, “minimize slippage”), constraints

2. Solvers/Executors monitor intents
Watch intent pool (on-chain or through a PubSub model)

Calculate the best path to fulfill the intent (e.g., Jupiter for swaps, Orca for LP, MarginFi for lending)

Simulate route and submit execution back on-chain

3. Protocol validates execution
Smart contract verifies output meets or exceeds the user's constraints

Rewards the solver if valid (fee, rebate, or bounty)

⚙️ MVP Scope for Hackathon
Smart Contracts (Anchor)
Intent struct

Submit + cancel intent

Execute intent (with checks + incentives)

Optional: escrow funds in a vault

Solvers (off-chain bots)
Node.js or Rust bot

Uses APIs (Jupiter Aggregator, Orca, Solend)

Monitors open intents and submits fulfillments

Frontend (React + Solana Wallet Adapter)
Form to create intents

View open intents + execution status

Show history + stats

🌐 Composability
You can plug into:

Jupiter: Aggregated swaps

Orca, Raydium: LP opportunities

Drift, Mango: Leverage or futures

Marinade, Lido: Staking destinations

Eventually, allow custom solvers—anyone can write bots and earn from fulfilling intents better than others.

🧩 Why It’s a Big Deal
User simplicity: No need to know DeFi mechanics

Execution efficiency: Solvers compete → better pricing, yield

Scalability: Composable across the Solana DeFi stack

Capital efficiency: Intent routing can unlock more value per transaction

🔥 Optional Extensions (Post-MVP)
Intent NFTs: Let intents be tokenized + tradable

Private intents: Use ZK or off-chain intent relay

Intent bundling: Combine multiple intents into one mega transaction

MEV-capture: Build Jito-aware solvers to extract and share value
